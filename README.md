# ETH-AVAX-Module-4

## Description

The Degen Token is an ERC20-compliant token smart contract written in Solidity. It allows users to transfer and manage tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract supports functionalities such as transferring tokens, approving token transfers, minting new tokens, redeeming tokens, burning token, check balance i.e total supply. 

we have taken ->Token Name: Degen Token
-> Token Symbol: DEGEN for deployment of the dependencies of the project 


## Functionality:

Your task is to create a ERC20 token and deploy it on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming. The smart contract should have the following functionality:

1. Minting new tokens: The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.
2. Transferring tokens: Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.
3. Redeeming tokens: Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.
4. Checking token balance: Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.
5. Burning tokens: Anyone should be able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.



### Network Setup

Fuji Testnet Settings:

  Network Name: ```Avalanche Fuji C-Chain```

  New RPC URL: ```https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc```

  ChainID: ```43113```

  Symbol: ```AVAX```

  Explorer: ```https://testnet.snowtrace.io/```


### Executing program and Deployment
1. Connect Remix IDE with MetaMask Wallet by changing environment to Inject provider.
2. Deploy the contract in the Avalanche network
3. Get the API key from ```snowtracer.io```
4. Get the contract verified. You'd need Contract address, compiler versoin, API key and contract name.
5. 5.Players can then start interacting with the contract using the functions provided - transfer, redeem, and checkBalance - to participate in Degen Gaming and earn rewards.
